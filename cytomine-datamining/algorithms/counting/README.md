# CellCounting

Implementation and evaluation of cell counting algorithms with randomized trees 
(especially Extra-Trees) and deep learning (convolutional neural networks).
 
This work has been initially developed in the context of 
[this master thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/2268.2/3237).

These algorithms have been implemented to be easily launched from the 
[Cytomine software](http://cytomine.be), providing a user-friendly interface.
